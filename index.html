        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello. I am Michael Chung and I am currently a newly introduced student at the University of California Riverside. I am eighteen years old and I live in the city of Walnut in California. I graduated from Walnut High School last year with the drive to be successful despite the hardships and obstacles that can oppose me. I am studying economics and accounting to one day be an exceptional employee and to help contribute to our economy's goal of prosperity and success. Right now, I am undergoing my first year as a college student and I am exceeding my expectations grades-wise because I have a 3.8 grade point average, but I always want to improve. College has made me realize how I can work hard and eventually, I can accomplish any situation presented before me. I have utilized excellent time management skills to help aid my experience in these college courses.<br><br>

        In the past, I have worked as a youth basketball coach for my local gym, worked at one of the score tables for multiple basketball games for Maxpreps, and worked at a concession stand for a girl's softball league in Sierra Madre. I have also been in multiple clubs such as Key Club, ECGA, and Hoops for Hope to help the community out when I am available and to lead others in example toward a successful route for them in the future. I have also completed many volunteer events, such as free basketball camps for the youth, beach cleanups along the California coast, and elderly aid throughout the years, which helped me shape my character.<br><br>

        My past occupations as a coach, a scorekeeper, and a concession stand clerk aided me into making me a person of patience and acceptance, while still having the eagerness to exert as much effort into a task despite the hindrances that block the lane toward success. My eagerness to learn assisted the rigors of the past occupations because I was able to patiently interpret a situation and act upon it, thus the highly accepted outcome can be achieved. These scenarios helped me adapt to changes quickly and it shaped me to strive to success. Being both a coach and a scorekeeper, I was able to become highly organized and detail orientated on the various tasks I was assigned, such as instructing my players a certain strategy to win the game or to differentiate which team is winning. As a coach, I was able to listen to my players and understand what task they have in front of them, which helped me become more attentive to the words that they were saying. My past occupations has made me a person of high organization, adaptability, initiative, acknowledgement, and time management skills.
